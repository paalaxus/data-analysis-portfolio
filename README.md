# kofi Boafo - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Kofi! I have a technical background and have a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.  after earning my degree, i grew an interest in Data and Analytics and pursued a masters degree in Data Science. These are projects I have done in my spare time.


<br>
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
